Hello Student,
Today we are learning FILE HANDLING.
For this we have to know what it is.
In PHP, File handling is the process of interacting with files on the server, such as reading files, writing to a file, creating new files, or deleting existing ones.
Before you can read or write to a file, you need to open it using the fopen() function, which returns a file pointer resource. Once you're done working with the file, you should close it using fclose() to free up resources..
hello world.
Good Morning.
